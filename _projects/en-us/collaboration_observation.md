I have contributed to observational papers on z > 6 galaxies detected by JWST and ALMA as a theoretical interpretation (e.g., Harikane+24, Hashimoto+23) and creating mock images (e.g., Lines+24, Tanaka+24) as shown in Figure 5. My extensive knowledge and research experience of high-z objects from cosmic dawn to EoR ensures that I am the right person to further explore the earliest epoch of the Universe through the research projects.
